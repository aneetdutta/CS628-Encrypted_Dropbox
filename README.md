This is the repository for CS 628 Assignment #1. Here we are uploading assn1.go which contains the code.

The objective of the project is to design a secure file storage system(like Google drive or Dropbox) with the assumption that server where we are uploading our files is itself vulnerbale and can not modify/aletrnate the content of our files without the proper permission of the owner. The collaboration and revokation is also implemented among different entitities on a single file.
